/* ****************** PROBLEM STATEMENT   *****************************

A and B are brothers and like playing with marbles.Their mother buys them N marbles to play with.
The preciousness of each marble is a natural number from 1 to N and no two marbles have same preciousness.

Since A and B are good at maths they want to divide all those N marbles among them in such a way that sum of the preciousness
 of all marbles that A receives and sum of the preciousness of all marbles that B receives after distribution are co-primes 
 i.e the gcd(greatest common divisor) of their sum is 1.

Also the absolute value of difference between the sum of the preciousness of marbles of A and B should be exactly M.

Help A and B in finding whether such a distribution of N marbles between them is possible or not.

Formally, you have to tell whether you can distribute first N natural numbers in two sets such that the absolute difference 
of the sum of numbers in the two sets is equal to M and the gcd of their sum is 1.


Note that one of the set can be empty and greatest common divisor of 0 and k is k 

Input
------------------------
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers N and M denoting the number of marbles and the absolute difference of sum respectively.

Output
-----------------------
For each test case, output a single line.
Print “Yes” if there exist a valid distribution of marbles between A and B else print “No”.

Constraints
-----------------------
1 = T = 20
1 = N = 1,000,000,000
0 = M = 1018
Example
Input:
----------------------
2
5 7
1 2 


Output:
---------------------
Yes
No
